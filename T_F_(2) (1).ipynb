        "# Task\n",
        "Here's an explanation of each component shown in the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture diagram:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Input (d₁)**: This represents the raw input data to the CNN. For image data, this would be the pixels of an image, typically a 2D or 3D array (height x width x color channels). For text data, this could be a sequence of word embeddings. The `d₁` often refers to the dimensions of this input.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Embedding Layer**: While not explicitly labeled as a separate block in this diagram, in the context of text classification (like fake news detection), the input `d₁` would often first pass through an Embedding Layer. This layer converts sparse categorical input (like words or tokens) into dense, lower-dimensional vector representations (embeddings). These embeddings capture semantic relationships between words, which is crucial for NLP tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Convolutional Layers (Conv-1, Conv-2, Conv-3)**: These are the core building blocks of a CNN.\n",
        "    *   **Filters/Kernels (k₁×k₁, k₂×k₂, k₃×k₃)**: Each convolutional layer applies a set of learnable filters (also called kernels) of a specified size (e.g., k₁x k₁) to the input. These filters slide across the input data, performing a dot product with the local region they cover. This operation extracts features like edges, textures, or specific patterns. In the context of text, these filters detect n-grams (sequences of words) or patterns in word embeddings.\n",
        "    *   **Channels (n₁, n₂, n₃)**: Each filter generates one feature map. The `n₁, n₂, n₃` indicate the number of such feature maps (or channels) in each convolutional layer. More channels mean the layer can learn to detect a greater variety of features. As data passes through successive convolutional layers, the network learns increasingly complex and abstract features.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Pooling Layers (often implied after Conv layers)**: Although not explicitly shown as separate blocks, pooling layers (like Max Pooling or Average Pooling) are typically interleaved between convolutional layers. Their purpose is to reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps, which helps to:\n",
        "    *   Reduce the number of parameters and computation in the network.\n",
        "    *   Control overfitting.\n",
        "    *   Make the learned features more robust to small shifts or distortions in the input (translation invariance).\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Flatten**: After several convolutional and pooling layers, the high-dimensional feature maps are flattened into a single, long vector. This transformation is necessary to connect the convolutional part of the network to the fully connected layers that follow.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Fully Connected Layers (Dense Layers)**: These are standard neural network layers where every neuron in one layer is connected to every neuron in the next layer.\n",
        "    *   They take the flattened feature vector as input.\n",
        "    *   They learn non-linear combinations of the high-level features extracted by the convolutional layers.\n",
        "    *   These layers are responsible for learning the final classifications based on the features. The diagram shows multiple neurons in this section, indicating the network's ability to learn complex relationships from the features.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Output**: The final layer of the network, which produces the model's prediction.\n",
        "    *   For a binary classification task like fake news detection, this would typically be a single neuron with a sigmoid activation function, outputting a probability (e.g., 0 for fake, 1 for real).\n",
        "    *   The diagram shows multiple output nodes (labeled Alpha, Beta, Delta, Gamma, Omicron), suggesting a multi-class classification problem. In our case of binary fake news detection, it would simplify to two outputs or one output with a threshold.\n",
        "\n",
        "This architecture allows a CNN to automatically learn hierarchical representations from raw data, starting with low-level features and progressing to high-level, abstract features, making it highly effective for tasks like image recognition and text classification. The diagram effectively illustrates this flow, from input to feature extraction and finally to classification."
